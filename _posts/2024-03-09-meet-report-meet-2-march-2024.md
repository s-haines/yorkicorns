An astonishing 16 people chose to come to Yorkicorns #2, and I think it is fair 
to say we had a great time.

With the first meet completed, we learnt and did a few things differently this time. 
Bexi headed straight to Wetherspoons, to secure the tables in the prime corner 
position. Meanwhile, Maz headed to the railway station, with a new meeting point 
The Coffee Room on platform 9 – importantly a place inside and with seats. After 
meeting Juniper and gang, we left the station at half ten, earlier than the previous 
month. We walked along the York city walls, and soon met with the sizeable 
contingent that had assembled at Wetherspoons.

This meet, I had button badges of the Yorkicorns crest to give out. The crest was 
created by PiratPeter, inspired by the coat of arms of the City of York Council, 
but turned into a bubble tea, with boba instead of lions. Everyone left with a 
badge, with plenty more for any future first-timers.

In addition to the usual meet shenanigans, this month PiratPeter brought along 
printouts of references for Freya the Valkyrie and Björk the Yakicorn and a huge 
stash of pencils.

There were plenty of great efforts, such as this one of Freya by Juniper:

Spideypool created new lore that the goddess Freya rides a chariot pulled by a 
clowder of cats:

I also made an effort at sketching Björk with limited success:

As more people arrived, we commandeered more tables, creating a table snake. Most 
at nearby tables took no notice of us, but a few looked in in surprise at the 
colour ponies decorating our table. Stickers made a return too:

After plenty of drinks (including some accidental English sparkling wine), it was 
3pm and the meet parted ways. Some braved the downpour and headed into town for a 
visit to HMV and bubble tea, a few headed home and a handful remained behind at 
the pub. 

Thank you everyone for coming along to Yorkicorns #2 and making it a great day out. 
I look forward to Yorkicorns #3 on Saturday 6th April!
