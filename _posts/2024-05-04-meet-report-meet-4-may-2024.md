In honour of Star Wars, and because it fits our normal schedule, the Yorkicorns met once more on May the fourth.
<!--more-->

PiratPeter and I held a pre-meet, but not of the usual kind; we went to 
[Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/heslington/), a weekly free timed 5k run. After the run and a quick shower,
together with Bexi, we descended upon The Postern Gate for the meet to begin.

The meet welcomed some regular faces, but also someone who was attending their first ever meet!

Unfortunately, I don't recall much of what happened after this, as I write this over three weeks after the 
event. At least this meet report acknowledges that Yorkicorns Meet #4 took place and there were no noteworthy 
disasters.
