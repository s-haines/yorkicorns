As Bexi and I waited for the bus into the city, we still weren’t quite sure 
what to expect for the first Yorkicorns meet. We knew that some people had 
begun their journeys hours earlier, but the questions of “how many people 
would come?” and “would it be fun?” still lingered.

Around 10am, Bexi and I arrived at the agreed meeting point; Costa Coffee 
on platform 9 of York railway station and got a coffee and breakfast bap. 
To our surprise, the seating around the coffee shop wasn’t set up, and thus 
we were without a place to sit down and chill out for the pre-meet! Not long 
later, Aurora (with a huge Izzy plush poking out their rucksack), Librase 
and Katie arrived. We looked around, but with some cancelled and delayed 
services, the seating on the platforms and the waiting room were occupied. 
By 10.30am, with no seat forthcoming, Bexi, Librase and Katie resolved to set 
off early to secure the table at the pub, while Aurora and I continued 
trainspotting, on the off-chance another pony-person might appear. 

At 11am, Aurora and I set off for The Postern Gate, a Wetherspoons pub just to 
the south of the city centre. Along the way we spotted sculptures in the York 
Ice Trail, including a piece called “Throne of Kings,” sponsored by Storage 
King. It wasn’t long until we arrived and discovered the advance party had 
secured a group of tables in the prime position: the far corner.

PiratPeter, Nekky, Solar Wave and Nick all joined us at the pub, and it wasn’t 
long until our table was full of pony plushies and we were talking about ponies, 
meets and conventions. Some played video games, others drew. We compared where 
the nine attendees had travelled from: only three from York itself, while the 
others came from as far as Carlisle (100 miles as the crow flies), Leicester 
(90 miles), Lancaster (70 miles), Nottingham (70 miles), and Manchester (65 
miles) – some valiant efforts!

There was a constant stream of food and drinks delivered to our table courtesy of 
the Wetherspoons app (although we were only informed by a staff member toward the 
end of the meet that we had misread our table’s number as “9” instead of “6”). 
As a gift to attendees, I had printed small stickers saying “I went to Yorkicorns 
#1”, and to tease Bexi, I also printed small stickers that said “I met Bexi at 
Yorkicorns #1”, which were both well received and now feature on a phone, tablet 
and laptop.

An important task for attendees of Yorkicorns #1 was to design the mascot. With 
York’s huge history, there was a lot to draw upon. The consensus trended towards 
a yak with a unicorn horn (or “yakicorn”, if you will), wearing a helmet, 
reminiscent of typical Viking imagery. Names such as Astrid, Alruna were suggested, 
although the most popular seemed to be Björk (like York). PiratPeter applied 
himself and we quickly had a sketch of Björk the York yakicorn. A second mascot 
named “Freya” was also agreed upon.

Before we knew it, it was 3pm and the scheduled end of the meet. Two had to leave to 
begin their journeys home, while Bexi treated the rest of us to a guided tour of 
the city centre, with a stop to get bubble tea, a particularly amusing stop to 
admire a statue at the stonemasons’ workshop at York Minster, and a walk along 
the Shambles, before saying goodbye for now.

Thank you for everyone for coming along, I had a great time and from the messages in 
the Discord server, it looks like you all did too! I look forward to the next one 
on Saturday 2nd March!
