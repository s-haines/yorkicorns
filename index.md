# About Yorkicorns

Yorkicorns is the York brony meetup.

Founded by Bexi and Maz in January 2024, Yorkicorns is a social meetup that aims to promote friendship amongst bronies in the York area and further afield.

# Next Meet-Up: Sunday 18<sup>th</sup> August 2024

The seventh Yorkicorns meetup will take place on **Sunday 18<sup>th</sup> August 2024**.

From **10:00**, the pre-meet will begin near the **Costa Coffee located on platform 9 of York Railway Station** (postcode YO24 1AB). Early ponies can join Maz for some coffee and train spotting, on what will be the first Yorkicorns meet without train strikes. Note that there is limited seating in this area.

At **10:30**, we'll depart and walk approximately one mile to the main meet location through the city centre, via George Hudson Street, Micklegate and Piccadilly. Alternatively, take the number 7 bus from outside the station to the Barbican, and then walk approximately 200m.

The main meet begins around **11:00** at [**The Postern Gate**](https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/north-yorkshire/the-postern-gate-york), a Wetherspoons pub located on Piccadilly (postcode YO1 9NX).

The meet at The Postern Gate is expected to wrap up around **15:00**. After this, one contingent is going to a cat cafe, while the other may go for a walk into town, get some bubble tea and explore a few shops, although exactly what we do depends on how we feel and our journeys home.

If you plan to attend, please let us know to expect you by posting in our Discord server.

# Mascot

Yorkicorns has two mascots: Björk the York Yakicorn (yak with unicorn horn) and Freya the Valkyrie.

PiratPeter generously created the above reference sheet ([full size here](/assets/images/Yorkicorn_Turnarounds_full.jpg)), showing Björk and Freya in all their glory. PiratPeter also created the crest of Yorkicorns ([full size here](/assets/images/Yorkicorn_Cutiemark_Vector_full.png)), modelled on the coat of arms of the City of York council, but reshaped into a bubble tea with boba replacing the heraldic lions:

Look out for exclusive merchandise of our mascots and crest, available freely to attendees of Yorkicorns.
