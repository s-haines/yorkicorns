# About Yorkicorns

Yorkicorns is the York brony meetup.

Founded by Bexi and Maz in January 2024, Yorkicorns is a social meetup that aims to promote friendship amongst bronies in the York area and further afield.

# Next Meet-Up: Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> January 2025

The 11<sup>th</sup> Yorkicorns meetup will take place on **Saturday 11<sup>th</sup> January 2025**.

The meet begins around **11:00** at [**The Postern Gate**](https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/north-yorkshire/the-postern-gate-york), a Wetherspoons pub located on Piccadilly (postcode YO1 9NX).

The meet at The Postern Gate is expected to wrap up around **15:00**. After this, we typically take a walk around the historic city, getting some bubble tea and exploring a few shops, although exactly what we do depends on how we feel and our journeys home.

If you plan to attend, please let us know to expect you by posting in our Discord server.

# Mascot

Yorkicorns has two mascots: Björk the York Yakicorn (yak with unicorn horn) and Freya the Valkyrie.

PiratPeter generously created the above reference sheet ([full size here](/assets/images/Yorkicorn_Turnarounds_full.jpg)), showing Björk and Freya in all their glory. PiratPeter also created the crest of Yorkicorns ([full size here](/assets/images/Yorkicorn_Cutiemark_Vector_full.png)), modelled on the coat of arms of the City of York council, but reshaped into a bubble tea with boba replacing the heraldic lions:

Look out for exclusive merchandise of our mascots and crest, available freely to attendees of Yorkicorns.
