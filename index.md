# Mascot

Yorkicorns has two mascots: Björk the York Yakicorn (yak with unicorn horn) and Freya the Valkyrie.

PiratPeter generously created the above reference sheet ([full size here](/assets/images/Yorkicorn_Turnarounds_full.jpg)), showing Björk and Freya in all their glory. PiratPeter also created the crest of Yorkicorns ([full size here](/assets/images/Yorkicorn_Cutiemark_Vector_full.png)), modelled on the coat of arms of the City of York council, but reshaped into a bubble tea with boba replacing the heraldic lions:

Look out for exclusive merchandise of our mascots and crest, available freely to attendees of Yorkicorns.
