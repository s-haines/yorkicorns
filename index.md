# About Yorkicorns

Yorkicorns is the York brony meetup.

Founded by Bexi and Maz in January 2024, Yorkicorns is a social meetup that aims to promote friendship amongst bronies in the York area and further afield.

# Next Meet-Up: Sunday 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2025

The 17<sup>th</sup> Yorkicorns meetup will take place on **Sunday 3<sup>rd</sup> August 2025**.

The meet begins around **11:00** outside Cuppa Joy (our usual boba shop) in St Helen's Square, before we head to Museum Gardens for a picnic in the [hopefully] nice weather!

Some food and drink will be provided, although we'd welcome any other contributions to the spread. A Sainsbury's Local convenience store is nearby for any last minute purchases.

We expect the meet to wrap up around **15:00**. 

If you plan to attend, please let us know to expect you by posting in our Discord server.

In case of poor weather, we'll spend the day at The Postern Gate, our usual Wetherspoons pub. Check our Discord server on the day for any changes.

# Mascot

Yorkicorns has two mascots: Björk the York Yakicorn (yak with unicorn horn) and Freya the Valkyrie.

PiratPeter generously created the above reference sheet ([full size here](/assets/images/Yorkicorn_Turnarounds_full.jpg)), showing Björk and Freya in all their glory. PiratPeter also created the crest of Yorkicorns ([full size here](/assets/images/Yorkicorn_Cutiemark_Vector_full.png)), modelled on the coat of arms of the City of York council, but reshaped into a bubble tea with boba replacing the heraldic lions:

Look out for exclusive merchandise of our mascots and crest, available freely to attendees of Yorkicorns.
